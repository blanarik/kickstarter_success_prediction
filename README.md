# Prediction of Project Success on Crowdfunding Portals
On the internet, there are many portals, using crowdfunding as a mean of obtaining a starting capital to run any kind of project, these days. These projects can, but do not have to be successful. However, their authors will not know until the end of a campaign. In this work, we propose a solution for the task of project success prediction. Our method is using metadata as well as dynamic data to predict project success in four different stages of the campaign (= four different models). It is a multiclass classification into four different classes representing chosen intervals of pledged money and goal ratio. As far as we know, we are the first to do this kind of classification. The method was tested on real data from Kickstarter. The accuracy of each of the four models is 76, 81, 85 and 92\%, which means that designed method is working and the accuracy is growing during the project campaign. For this reason, it can be used for project success prediction task. The method itself is not connected to Kickstarter and can be used for prediction on all crowdfunding portals.
